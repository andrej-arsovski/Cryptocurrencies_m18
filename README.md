# Cryptocurrency classification

The goal of this work was to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and group them to create a classification system for this new investment.

Unsupervised machine learning was used to find patterns between the different currencies

Data cleanup was needed in order for the processed data to fit the machine learning models.

Data dimensions were reduced using Principal Component analysis.

Cryptocurrencies were clustered using K-means

Visualizations were done using 2D and 3D scatter plots
